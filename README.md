# Interval Numbers: A Rigorous Treatment of Indeterminate Forms

**Author:** Norbert Nopper

## Abstract

The expressions $0 \cdot \infty$ and $0 \cdot (-\infty)$ are classical indeterminate forms that resist standard algebraic manipulation, even under extended real arithmetic. This work introduces **interval numbers**, a formal framework for representing indeterminate forms as closed intervals in the extended real line $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$. We define $[x_0, x_1]_{in}$ as a mathematical object whose endpoints span the limits realizable by directional limit sequences associated with each indeterminate form, enabling algebraic operations on forms previously considered undefined. We establish that interval-number operations follow standard interval arithmetic rules and that the algebraic structure constitutes a **unital magma** under multiplication: closed and equipped with a two-sided identity $[1,1]_{in}$, but not associative. Formal operations (multiplication, addition, subtraction, division, absolute value, and exponentiation) are presented and their consistency is illustrated through explicit examples. A C++ reference implementation with a comprehensive unit-test suite is provided alongside the paper as a working artefact.

**Keywords:** indeterminate forms, interval arithmetic, extended real numbers, algebraic structure, interval algebra
