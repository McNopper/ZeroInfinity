# Solving indeterminate forms using interval arithmetic

*by Norbert Nopper*

#### Credits

Thanks to Eric Lengyel for asking the initial right questions.

Thanks a lot to my family and their patience having me as a ðŸ¤“.

### Thesis

$$0 \cdot âˆž = -1 \cdot (0 \cdot -âˆž)$$

#### Status quo

The expressions $0 \cdot âˆž$ and implicitly $0 \cdot -âˆž$ are indeterminate forms [1].

A naive approach like $-1 \cdot (0 \cdot -âˆž)$ <=> $(-1 \cdot 0) \cdot -âˆž$ with math limits [2] results again in $0 \cdot -âˆž$ even when the associative law is allowed.

Existing required math limits for above assumption:

$\lim_{n\to\infty}\sqrt[n]{n}=1$  
$\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}=0$  

Assume the usage of the associative law is allowed:

$\lim_{n\to\infty}-\sqrt[n]{n} \cdot \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n} = \lim_{n\to\infty}-\sqrt[n]{n} \cdot \frac{1}{n} = \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{-1}{n}$

The result is again 0.

### Idea

In interval arithmetic, the intervals $[0, âˆž]$ and $[-âˆž, 0]$ are allowed [3].

The indeterminate form of $0 \cdot âˆž$ can be expressed as the interval $[0, âˆž]$.  
Similar, the indeterminate form of $0 \cdot -âˆž$ is $[-âˆž, 0]$.

The interval $[x_0, x_1]$ is estimated from $a * b \in \mathbb R \land a \le b$ providing following rule:

$$[x_0, x_1] = \{ x_0 = a * b \, | \, b \in [a, b[ \, \land \, x_1 = a * b  \, | \, a \in ]a, b] \}$$

### Interval arithmetic operators

*ToDo:*  
*Define Addition and Multiplication for minimal algebraic structure Ring [4].*

### Deduction

$-1 \cdot (0 \cdot -âˆž)$  
$-1 \cdot [-âˆž, 0]$  
$[-1 \cdot -âˆž, -1 \cdot 0]$  
$[0, âˆž]$  
$0 \cdot âˆž$

*ToDo:*  
*For each step, name the rules and operators.*

### Implementation

In the [test](test/) folter is an implementation of this interval arithmetic.   

*ToDo:*  
*Depending on the mathematical Ring, extend implementation and unit tests.*

### Conclusion

Using this approach, other indeterminate forms could be expressed as an interval and solved to equations as well.

*ToDo:*  
*Add investigation, if the algebraic structure is more than a mathematical Ring.*
