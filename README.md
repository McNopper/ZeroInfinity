Thanks to Eric Lengyel for asking the initial right questions.

Thanks a lot to my family and their patience having me as a ðŸ¤“.

## Motivation

The expressions $0 \cdot âˆž$ and implicitly $0 \cdot -âˆž$ are indeterminate forms [1]. It is not possible to do any calculus on these expressions like $-1 \cdot (0 \cdot -âˆž)$.  
However, compared to $x = -1 \cdot -x$, intuitively the following equation should be true: 

$$0 \cdot âˆž = -1 \cdot (0 \cdot -âˆž)$$

### Problem

A naive approach like $-1 \cdot (0 \cdot -âˆž) = (-1 \cdot 0) \cdot -âˆž$ with math limits results again in $0 \cdot -âˆž$ even when the associative law is allowed.

#### Investigation

Existing required math limits for above assumption:

$\lim_{n\to\infty}\sqrt[n]{n}=1$  
$\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}=0$  

Assume the usage of the associative law is allowed:

$\lim_{n\to\infty}-\sqrt[n]{n} \cdot \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n} = \lim_{n\to\infty}-\sqrt[n]{n} \cdot \frac{1}{n} = \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{-1}{n}$

The result is again 0 and does not provide the expected result.

## New interval number

### Assumption

In the case of the given two indeterminate forms, the result could be **any** number. However, the resulting number can be enclosed in an interval.  

#### Using extended real number  

Using the extended real number system $\overline {\mathbb R}$ [2], the intervals $[0, âˆž]$ and $[-âˆž, 0]$ are allowed.

#### Enclosing the result in an interval

Following is given:

$a, b \in \overline {\mathbb R} \land a \le b$

Interval, where the result for $a \cdot b$ is enclosed in the interval: 

$[x_0, x_1] = \{ x_0 = a \cdot \beta | \beta \in [a, b[ \land x_1 = \alpha \cdot b | \alpha \in ]a, b] \}$

### Definition

As the result is probably not **all** numbers in the interval, **any** or at least **one** number in the interval has to be expressed as a new interval number *in*:

$[x_0, x_1]in := \{ x \in \overline {\mathbb R} | \exists x \in [x_0, x_1] \}$

The indeterminate form of $0 \cdot âˆž$ can be expressed as the first rule:

***Rule I***  
$0 \cdot âˆž = [0, âˆž]in$

Similar, the expression for the indeterminate form of $0 \cdot -âˆž$ is the second rule:

***Rule II***  
$0 \cdot -âˆž = [-âˆž, 0]in$

### Interval number operation

These is the given mathematical operation.

#### Multiplication

$[x_0, x_1]in \cdot [y_0, y_1]in = [\min(x_0 \cdot y_0, x_1 \cdot y_1), \max(x_0 \cdot y_0, x_1 \cdot y_1)]in$

Regarding the algebraic structure [3], only the required multiplication for the given rules are investigated.

This algebraic structure of the interval numbers is at least a Magma [4], as all multiplications in $\overline {\mathbb R}$ including ***Rule I*** and ***Rule II*** are defined.

### Deduction

|                               | Operation or rule                    |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| $-1 \cdot (0 \cdot -âˆž)$       | ***Rule II***                        |
| $-1 \cdot [-âˆž, 0]in$          | Multiplication for interval number   |
| $[-1 \cdot -âˆž, -1 \cdot 0]in$ | Operation in $\overline {\mathbb R}$ |
| $[0, âˆž]in$                    | ***Rule I***                         |
| $0 \cdot âˆž$                   |                                      |

### Implementation

In the [test](test/) folder is a C++ implementation of the interval number and the unit tests.

### Conclusion

Using this approach, other indeterminate forms could be expressed as an interval and solved to equations as well.

For now it is shown, that the algebraic structure of the interval number is a Magma. However, including the other mathematical operations, the algebraic structure could be further investigated.

Furthermore, other intervals for indeterminate forms could be estimated and defined.
